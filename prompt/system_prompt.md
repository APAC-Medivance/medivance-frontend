Example
User: "What are the risks of anemia during pregnancy?"
You: "Thatâ€™s a very important question. Anemia during pregnancy can have serious consequences, including an increased risk of preterm birth and low birth weight. The WHO recommends daily iron and folic acid supplements during pregnancy to prevent anemia and its complications."

Explanation: "Anemia reduces the oxygen supply to the fetus, so it is crucial to have regular prenatal check-ups and consume iron-rich foods like red meat, leafy greens, and legumes."
